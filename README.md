Documentation builder console application for WebService, WebAPI and WCF applications

This console application can create user friendly documentation for you ASP.NET services.
To achieve this goal we will do a few steps: analyze assembly, map found members to XML docs files, that generated by Visual Studio and apply XSLT transformation.

## Input arguments:
/T - What do we want to analyze or apply.
    0 - Doing nothing
    1 - Apply XSLT transofmation (Required:/IX, /IT /O)
    2 - Analyze WCF application (Required: /ID, /O)
    4 - Analyze WebAPI application (Required: /ID, /O)
    8 - Analyze WebService application (Required: /ID, /O)

We can apply multiply tasks with this parameter. For example:
    2|4 - Search for WCF and WebAPI instances.
    2|8 - Search for WCF and WebServices instances.
    2|4|8 - Search for WCF, WebAPI and WebServices instances.

/IX - XML documentation files for assemblies (Description: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5ast78ax.aspx)
/ID - Input main assembly file (Referenced assemblies resoved by default algorithms)
/O - Outputh path. Where result files will be placed
/IT - Path to XSLT file for XML transformation after extraction
/R - Absolute URL to the application root folder

## Limitations
1) WebAPI classes/methods MUST contain RoutePrefixAttribute/RouteAttribute
2) WebAPI supported attributes: HttpDelete, HttpGet, HttpHead, HttpOptions, HttpPost, HttpPut, HttpTrace
3) WCF classes/methods MUST contain ServiceContractAttribute/WebInvokeAttribute
4) WebService classes MUST contain WebServiceAttribute/WebMethodAttribute
5) Single class can containts only once technology

## Example:
/IX:TestService.xml /O:"C:\TestService\Docs" /ID:TestService.dll /R:"https://github.com/MyApplication/v100" /T:14
    /IX:TestService.xml - XML documentation file
    /O:"C:\TestService\Docs" - Path to the output directory
    /ID:TestService.dll - Assembly from whitch we will extract service information
    /R:"https://github.com/MyApplication/v100" - URI for the root folder where out service is located
    /T:14 - (2|4|8) - Search for instances of WebAPI, WCF and WebServices
